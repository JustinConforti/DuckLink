# DuckLink
Project 3

If you're bored and need something to kill some time and have some fun, try out our site, Duck Link! Duck Link is a site where people can
create their own duck avatar, and play games! When you in a game, you get a token, which you can use to trade towards special duck 
accessories like a hat, a pair of eyes, or even a sword! 


When you first go into the website you will want to register. Your password will be hashed and the email is going to be used for contact 
purposes, such as needing to reset the password if necessary. After a user logs in, the home page is going to be meant to display the
user's own created duck.
